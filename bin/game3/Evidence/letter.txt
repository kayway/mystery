Dear Husband:

I'm writing you this letter to tell you that I'm leaving you for good. 

I've been a good woman to you for seven years and I have nothing to show for it.

These last two weeks have been hell. 

Your boss called to tell me that you had quit your job today and that was the last straw. 

Last week, you came home and you didn't notice that I had gotten my hair and nails done. 

You came home and ate in two minutes, and went straight to sleep after watching the game.  

Either you're cheating or you don't love me anymore, whatever the case is, I'm gone. 

Have a great life.
